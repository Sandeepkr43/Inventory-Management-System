# Inventory-Management-System
Inventory management systems are the means of organizing all the elements that go into inventory management. It's the process by which we track goods from one end to the other along the supply chain. 

we use json module
we have wholeseller store in which have all the product with their attributes.
we perfom read and write operation on json file.
we created list.json which has all the attributes of product id.
now we created a billing statement for what the user purchased
At last, we created a updated list json file which tells us the stocks availability.
